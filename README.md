# PWM-Generation-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to generate PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. PWM is widely used for motor speed control, LED dimming, and other applications requiring variable signal output.
# Features
Generates PWM signals with adjustable duty cycle.
Uses the PIC microcontroller's built-in PWM module.
Can be used for motor control, LED brightness control, and other applications.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC, 
Programming Language: Embedded C, 
IDE: MPLAB IDE, 
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The PIC microcontroller's PWM module is configured with a specific frequency.
The duty cycle is adjusted in the code to control output signal behavior.
The generated PWM signal is observed in Proteus for simulation.
