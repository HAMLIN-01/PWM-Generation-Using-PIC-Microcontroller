# PWM-Generation-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to generate PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. PWM is widely used for motor speed control, LED dimming, and other applications requiring variable signal output.
